# Advanced Pilot Training Aircraft System

This project involved the comprehensive design and fabrication of an advanced pilot-training aircraft intended for next-generation training programs. 
The aircraft was designed around two primary missions.

The first mission consisted of a training sortie flown at 3,000 feet elevation, operating 500 nautical miles from home base and completing four IFR traffic patterns. 
The second mission required carrying a 386-pound weapons cargo pod at an altitude of 18,000 feet over a 50-nautical-mile range, with delivery to ground forces.

The aircraft is powered by two GE J85 afterburning turbojet engines, producing a combined thrust of 10,000 pounds-force. 
Modeled after the Northrop F-5, the sleek configuration emphasizes stability, maneuverability, and speed, with dual rudders incorporated to provide additional redundancy.

Designed for a 50-year service life with 1,000 flight hours per year, the aircraft supports a production rate of five units per month over a three-and-a-half-year contract period. 
With a gross weight of 16,325 pounds, the aircraft offers a durable, accurate, and effective platform for pilot training well into the future.
