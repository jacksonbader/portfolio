# Analysis of Blended-Wing Body Aircraft

The purpose of this project was to introduce and analyze the characteristics of a blended-wing body (BWB) configuration for aircraft. This project was broken into two sections: wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. There were three main goals in mind: to determine the benefits of the blended wing body (BWB) configuration compared to that of a standard rectangular wing, to determine both computational and experimental data of the BWB, and to compare the use of fluid simulation software such as Ansys CFD and XFOIL to that of a physical model tested in San Diego State University’s low-speed wind tunnel.
