# Analysis of Blended-Wing Body Aircraft

The purpose of this project was to introduce and analyze the characteristics of a blended-wing body (BWB) configuration for aircraft. This project was broken into two sections: wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. There were three main goals in mind: to determine the benefits of the blended wing body (BWB) configuration compared to that of a standard rectangular wing, to determine both computational and experimental data of the BWB, and to compare the use of fluid simulation software such as Ansys CFD and XFOIL to that of a physical model tested in San Diego State University’s low-speed wind tunnel.

## CAD Model

The project started with the creation of a detailed CAD model based on the Boeing X-48. To ensure precise aerodynamic measurements, a simplified rendition of the model was employed to avoid potential disturbances to lift and drag data. Following the development of this model, a half-span representation was derived, taking advantage of the symmetric nature of the aircraft.
